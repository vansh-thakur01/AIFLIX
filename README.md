## About

This is a Netflix-inspired web application built from scratch to showcase my front-end development skills and integration of advanced features such as AI-powered recommendations, multilingual support, and user authentication. The project demonstrates my ability to combine modern web technologies with AI and state management to create an interactive experience.

> **Note:** The current version of the page is **not fully responsive**, and I am working on improving its responsiveness for various screen sizes.
